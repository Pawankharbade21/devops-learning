ðŸ”¹ 1. What is a Process?
      A process is simply a running instance of a program.
      Example: When you run firefox, Linux creates a process for it.
      Every process has:
        PID (Process ID) â†’ a unique number
        Parent Process ID (PPID) â†’ the process that started it
        State â†’ running, sleeping, stopped, zombie
        Owner/User
ðŸ”¹ 2. Viewing Processes
      ðŸ”¹ 1. ps â†’ Process Status
          Example output:
              PID TTY          TIME CMD
              1234 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
              2345 pts/0    00:00:00 python
              3456 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
              PID â†’ Process ID (unique number of the process)
              TTY â†’ Terminal
              TIME â†’ CPU time used
              CMD â†’ Command that started the process
          ðŸ‘‰ Try:
                ps aux | head
                  a= show all users
                  u= show usernames and details
                  x= show processes not attached to terminal
      ðŸ”¹ 2. top â†’ Live Process Monitoring
            Shows running processes in real-time (like Task Manager in Windows).
                top
                  PID â†’ Process ID
                  USER â†’ Owner
                  %CPU â†’ CPU usage
                  %MEM â†’ Memory usage
                  COMMAND â†’ Which program is running
      ðŸ”¹ 3. kill â†’ Kill a process
            Used to stop a process by its PID.
            ðŸ‘‰ First, find the process:
                ps aux | grep python   // grep is used to search 
              output: pawan   2345  2.0  1.2  123456  7890 pts/0  S+   10:30   0:00 python script.py // here 2345 is a process id
            ðŸ‘‰ Kill it:
              kill 2345
            If it doesnâ€™t stop, force kill:
              kill -9 2345
      ðŸ”¹ 4. jobs, fg, bg â†’ Background & Foreground jobs
            Run a program in background:  python script.py &
            Check jobs: jobs 
            Bring background job to foreground: fg %1
            Send running job to background:
            Press Ctrl+Z â†’ stops process, then run: bg %1
            ps -ef | grep sleep: if want to find a pid of sleep

          âš¡ So, these are the must-know process management commands:
          âœ… ps â€“ view processes
          âœ… top â€“ monitor processes live
          âœ… kill â€“ stop processes
          âœ… jobs, fg, bg â€“ manage background/foreground tasks
