Basics

File system Hierarchy

ðŸ“‚/bin â†’ Binaries (Essential User Commands)
	Contains basic command binaries needed by all users.
	Example: commands like ls, cp, mv, cat, echo, mkdir, etc. are stored here.
	These are "essential tools" â€” if /bin is broken, even the root user canâ€™t perform basic operations.

ðŸ“‚ /etc â†’ Configuration Files
		â€¢	Contains system-wide configuration files (not user-specific).
    * Examples:
        * /etc/passwd â†’ user account info
        * /etc/hostname â†’ system hostname
        * /etc/resolv.conf â†’ DNS settings
        * /etc/ssh/sshd_config â†’ SSH server settings
    * Whenever you install software, most of its config files go inside /etc.
ðŸ‘‰ Think of /etc as the "control center" of the system.

 ðŸ“‚ /var â†’ Variable Data
		â€¢	Contains files that change frequently.
    * Examples:
        *  /var/log/ â†’ system logs (important for debugging, e.g., /var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log)
        * /var/spool/mail/ â†’ emails
        * /var/cache/ â†’ cache data
    * Think of /var as a place where constantly changing data is stored.
ðŸ‘‰ If /var becomes full, services may crash because logs canâ€™t be written.

ðŸ“‚ /tmp â†’ Temporary Files
    * Stores temporary files created by users and apps.
    * Example: when you open a Word file or Chrome tab, temp data may be placed here.
    * Files inside /tmp are usually deleted on reboot.
    * ðŸ‘‰ Hackers sometimes use /tmp to execute scripts because itâ€™s writable by everyone.

ðŸ“‚ /root â†’ Root Userâ€™s Home Directory
    * This is the home directory of the root (superuser).
    * Equivalent to /home/root, but kept separate for security reasons.
    * Only root user has access to it.
ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like Adminâ€™s private room.
