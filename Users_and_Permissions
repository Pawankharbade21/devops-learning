These are must-know concepts that every Linux user should understand.
 1. What is a User in Linux?
  * Every action in Linux is tied to a user.
  * Types of users:
    * Root user → super administrator, unrestricted power.
    * Regular users → limited privileges, created for daily use.
    * System users → created for services (e.g., www-data for Apac
 2. User Identification
   * Each user has:
    * Username
    * UID (User ID)
    * GID (Group ID)
    * Home directory (default /home/username)
    * Shell (default /bin/bash)
Example entry:
  cat /etc/passwd // Run in Terminal
  pawan:x:1000:1000:Pawan:/home/pawan:/bin/bash
  * pawan → username
  * x → password stored in /etc/shadow
  * 1000 → UID
  * 1000 → GID
  * /home/pawan → home directory
  * /bin/bash → shell

User Management Commands
  * Create user: 
    * sudo adduser <username>
  * Delete user:
    * sudo deluser <username>
  * Change user password
    * sudo passwd <username>
Groups
  Groups help manage permissions for multiple users.
  * Add group:
    * sudo addgroup devteam // Run on terminal here devteam is group name under which all user lie
  * Add user to group
    * sudo usermod -aG devteam newuser
  * Check groups of user
    * groups newuser
File Ownership
  Every file has an owner and a group.
  * Check ownership:
    * ls -l file.txt
      Example: -rw-r--r-- 1 pawan devteam 1234 Aug 30 10:00 file.txt
      here pawan->owner and devteam->group
File Permissions
  * Read -> r
  * Write -> w
  * Execute -> x
  Permission format 
    * -rw-r--r--
      First char: file type (- file,d directory)
        Next 3 → owner permissions
        Next 3 → group permissions
        Last 3 → others permissions
Changing Ownership
  Change file owner:
    * sudo chown newowner file.txt
  Change group:
    * sudo chgrp devteam file.txt
  Change both:
    * sudo chown pawan:devteam file.txt
  chown: change user/owner (and optionally group too)
  chgrp: change group only
  chmod: change file permissions
Changing Permission
  * Symbolic Method :
      chmod u+x file.sh    # add execute for owner
      chmod g-w file.txt   # remove write from group
      chmod o=r file.txt   # others can only read
        * u → user
        * g → group
        * o → others
        * a → all
  * Numeric (Octal) Method:
      Each permission has a number:
        r = 4, w = 2, x = 1
      So:
        * 7 = rwx
        * 6 = rw-
        * 5 = r-x
        * 4 = r--
      chmod 755 script.sh   # rwx for owner, r-x for group, r-x for others
      chmod 644 file.txt    # rw- for owner, r-- for group & others
